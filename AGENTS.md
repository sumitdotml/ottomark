## Quality Guardrails

- Before any repository edit task, load `skills/mistake-memory-guardrails/SKILL.md`.
- Read `AGENT_MISTAKES.md` before proposing or applying edits.
- If a known pattern appears, revise until compliant before finalizing.
- Record every detected mistake occurrence in `AGENT_MISTAKES.md` using dedupe/update rules.
