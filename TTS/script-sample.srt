00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,000
Ope. Okay, there's a... there's a bear convention.

00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,500
Everything is very purple and... actively hostile.

00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,800
I'm not mad, I'm just processing the sheer amount of bear currently on my screen.

00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,800
No, yeah. That's fine. We won, I guess.

00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,000
Anyway. I'm gonna go get some Casey's.
